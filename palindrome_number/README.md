Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is palindrome integer.

An integer is a __palindrome__ when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, `121` is palindrome while `123` is not.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
__Example 3:__
```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
__Example 4:__
```
Input: x = -101
Output: false
```
