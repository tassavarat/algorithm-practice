Given a __non-empty__ array of integers `nums`, every element appears _twice_ except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

__Example 3:__
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```
